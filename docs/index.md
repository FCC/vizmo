### Overview


The FCC Visualizing Mobile Broadband API offers access to the aggregated results data from the FCC Speed Test Mobile Application. This includes:

- speed, latency, and packet loss for both upload and download
- carrier coverage based on speed, participation, and time of day

It is provided so that developers can further explore the data and build, or extend their applications in new and creative ways. If you use our APIs, please indicate the source on your page. Also, don't forget to tell us how you have used our platform in your projects! Send email to: developer@fcc.gov.



##### Get started
We built the API to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we organized this site into four major areas.

- [API Basics](basics.html) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API Calls](console/) gives you hands-on API experience with an interactive console.
- [API Output](output.html) displays sample output from the API.
- [API Fields](fields.html) lists and describes the type of information in the API output.
